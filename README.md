# VWisper - THIS PROJECT IS NOT GOING TO BE UPDATED OR MAINTANED
## Installation

### macOS

1. Download `VWisper.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/xptea/VWisper/releases) page.
2. Double-click the DMG to mount it. A window will appear showing `VWisper.app` and an **Applications** shortcut.
3. **Drag and drop** `VWisper.app` onto the **Applications** folder.
4. Eject the disk image, then launch VWisper from `/Applications`.

> On first launch macOS will ask for Microphone and Accessibility permissions—grant both so VWisper can record audio and handle global shortcuts.

### Windows

1. Download either `vwisper.exe` (regular installer) **or** `vwisper.msi` from the Releases page.
2. Run the chosen installer and follow the prompts.
3. After installation, start VWisper from the Start Menu or the desktop shortcut.

### Linux (coming soon)

Pre-built packages for major distributions will be provided in a future release. Until then you can clone the repository and follow the **Building** instructions above to build from source.
